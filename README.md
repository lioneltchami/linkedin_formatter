# Rich Text to Unicode Converter for LinkedIn

This web tool is designed to help you preserve your rich text formatting when posting on LinkedIn. Say goodbye to losing your bold and italic formatting when copying text from Microsoft Word to LinkedIn. With this converter, you can seamlessly convert your formatted texts to LinkedIn-compatible Unicode texts, ensuring your posts stand out with the exact styling you intended.

## How It Works

1. **Copy your Text**: Copy the rich text you wish to convert from Microsoft Word (or any other editor).
2. **Paste and Convert**: Paste your text into the input editor and click the "Convert for LinkedIn" button.
3. **Copy and Paste**: Copy the converted text from the output box and paste it into the LinkedIn post editor. Your formatting is preserved!

## Limitations

- Currently supports **bold** and *italic* formatted text only.
- Only ASCII characters are supported for bold/italic formatting. Avoid using special characters such as ö, ü, ß, etc., in bold/italic texts.
- Links and other non-text formatting cannot be pasted into the input editor, as they are not directly supported by LinkedIn.
